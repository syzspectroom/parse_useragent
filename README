#Simple browser Useragent parsing class

This is a simple class to parse useragent string based on PHP code from http://techpatterns.com/downloads/php_browser_detection.php .
Some ideas of Safari detection were taken from http://github.com/kuccello/Spy-Vs-Spy

Class can't handle mobile browsers and can't parse OS info Right now, but I'm working on it.
I'm a novice in Ruby development and I'm  learning Ruby with this project that's why code is far from ideal, but I hope someone could help me to do it more "Ruby"

#usage

require 'browsers.rb'
info = Browsers.new('Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/525.13 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/3.1 Safari/525.17')
info.detect
puts info.browsername
puts info.browser_version
